# Data pipeline to capture and analyze events generated by users of a mobile game

## Summary

The objective of this project is to prepare the infrastructure to capture the events generated by the users of a hypothetical mobile game.

Parts of the pipeline:

- Users interact with the mobile app.

- An app server handles user requests and log events to Kafka.

- Spark pulls events from Kafka, transforms them and writes them to HDFS.

- Once the data is available in HDFS, perform queries using Presto.
