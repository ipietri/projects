# Income inequality trend around the world

The **Income_Inequality_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.pdf** file contains the summary of the process used in this exploratory data analysis as well as the main findings.

The **code** directory has 5 Jupyter notebooks that contain the code for data cleaning and analysis to help in the exploratory data analysis of three research questions:

1. What is the trend of income inequality across the world in the last decade? Which countries/regions are doing better/worse? 

2. What is the relationship between economic growth and income inequality? 

3. What is the relationship between exposure to global trade and income inequality? (E.g. Do higher levels of exposure to global trade translate into lower inequality?) 

Jupyter Notebooks description: 

* **Q1-World_Income_Inequality_Trend_FINAL.ipynb​** - World Income Inequality dataset manipulation and visualizations related to research question 1. 

* **Q2_GDP_Analysis.ipynb** ​- Exploration of the GDP analysis and visualizations related to research question 2. 

* **Q2_Relationship_GDP_Inequality_dataset_prep.ipynb** -  ​Data preparation and merging Real GDP trend, GDP, and GDP per capita. 

* **Q3-Relationship_Trade_Intequality_dataset_prep.ipynb**​ - Datasets merging and preparation related to research question 3. 

* **Q3-Relationship_Trade_Inequality_data_analysis.ipynb** -​ Data exploration and visualizations related to research question 3. 

The **data** directory (inside the **code** directory) contains all the raw data and the cleaned-up datasets.

The **mapdata** (inside the **code** directory) directory contains some shape files to create maps visualizations.
