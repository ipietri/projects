# Exploring Data Augmentation Methods on Social Media Corpora

## Summary

This project explores data augmentation techniques in the context of text classification using a social media dataset. Popular varieties of data augmentation are explored:
- Oversampling
- Easy Data Augmentation ([Wei and Zou, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11196))
- Back-Translation ([Sennrich et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06709))
- Greyscaling, a relatively unexplored data augmentation technique that seeks to mitigate the intensity of adjectives in examples
- A few-shot learning approach: Pattern-Exploiting Training (PET) ([Schick et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07676))

For the experiments a BERT transformer architecture is used.
