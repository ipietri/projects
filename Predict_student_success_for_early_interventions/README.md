# Predicting Student Success for Early Interventions

The purpose of this project is to predict pass/fail of courses for early interventions that can help change student outcomes, in the context of distance learning. How early can we predict outcomes for intervention while still being reliable? Or how soon can we detect that a student is "slipping."

The data used comes from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/anlgrbz/student-demographics-online-education-dataoulad), and comprises student demographic data (location, age group, disability, education level, gender), performance data (student assessment marks) and interactions with the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE).

Through this project a number of models are created that effectively predict student outcomes halfway through the semester, exploring different algorithms: K-nearest neighbors, Naïve-bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Neural Networks ensembles.
